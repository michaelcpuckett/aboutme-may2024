### 24/09/01

- Refreshed VisualStuidoIDE API Certificates, fixing a bug caused by VSCode.LiveServer.Https and VisualStudioIDE interaction.
- Added a class to convert the one page of questions into 3 pages of 'Two Truths and a Lie'.
  - It's an interconnected mess, but I'll do better next time.

- Created a logical order for the js files
- Added Weather Kitty

### 24/08/28

- added loadash.js library: https://lodash.com/
  - shuffle();
- added htmlElement to questions class
  - probably need more help on how to use classes better
  - definitely need more help on how to use modules and libraries.
- separated the styles out into modular files to make it easier for me to work on.
- cleaned up and finished the question skeleton code
- fleshed out the question logic
- added additional submit and reset buttons and code.
- pretty happy with where this ended up today.
  - if I do refactor this into threes (two truths and a lie) ...
    - significant additional code? I feel like it would be, at least for me.
    - make it more of a card for mobile compatibility
    - animate the cards?
- Added initial Contact Page

### 24/08/27

- I have found the one example of where you don't want html, body { height 100%;}
  - I initially wanted equal vertical pages on a single page.
- Figured out the layout to have multiple vertical pages of equal height and commented it in the code.
- Set the page back to a single page that swaps the other pages in and out.
- Initial prototype of the two page design
- `displayValue = window.getComputedStyle(element).display;` unless you force set the value first. Otherwise it often reads '' on the first pass.
- Worked on nav buttons, and added WeatherKitty placeholder.

### 24/08/26
